RECIPE PROJECT

The project was mainly created in JavaScript and some elements in React.js in combination with Redux. The application is designed for users and culinary enthusiasts. It aims to reduce the user's stress and time spent thinking about what to eat for lunch or dinner. The site contains ready-made recipes of various dishes, which can be searched in the "Ready Recipe" section, which uses API technology. While another section "Own Recipes" was made in pure JavaScript. The chat for the project was made using the React.js framework with Redux for the application you need to log in with a google account. As for the styling of the application, all visual effects were made using the SCSS preprocessor, which was divided into appropriate modules.

Problems and challenges encountered:

The biggest difficulty and the most time was taken up with the creation of the chat, as this was the first use of React.js technology by ze me. This type of part of the project was a good introduction and exercise in using the React.js framework. This is not a fully completed application, but it already allows text messaging. Over time, voice chat, searching for messages on a given channel and many other functionalities will be added.
