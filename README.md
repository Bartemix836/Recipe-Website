# Recipe Website
RECIPE PROJECT

The project was created mainly in JavaScript and some elements in React.js combined with Redux. The app is designed for users and culinary enthusiasts. Its goal is to reduce user stress and time spent wondering what to eat for lunch or dinner. The site contains ready-made recipes of various dishes, which can be searched in the "Ready Recipe" section. An API was used to create it. Another section "Own Recipes" was made in pure JavaScript. Here the user can save his most interesting recipes. Chat for the project was made using React.js and Redux framework. We can only log into the application using a google account. As for the styling of the application, all visual effects were made using the SCSS preprocessor, which was divided into appropriate modules.

Problems and challenges encountered:

The biggest difficulty and the most time was the creation of the chat, as this was the first use of React.js technology by ze me. This type of part of the project was a good introduction and exercise in using the React.js framework. This is not a fully completed application, but it already allows for text messaging. In time, voice chat, searching for messages on a given channel and many other functionalities will be added.

HOW TO RUN CHATAPP:

Detailed instructions including information on how to start a chat application have been added on the "chatapp" gallery.
