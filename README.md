HOW TO RUN AppChat

1.Install npm in the folder where the src and public directories are located.

2.Use npm start command in termianl. 

3.In the index.html file located in the "main" gallery, check that the port on which the chat was launched is the same as in the address for the "a" tag located in the p tag with the class named "p-family".
